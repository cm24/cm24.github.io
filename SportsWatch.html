<h1 style="color:darkred;"><u>The Reason I Like...</u></h1>
<h2 style="color:darkblue;"><u>Basketball</u></h2>
<td>Basketball is definitely my most watched sport, I like the Golden State Warriors and watch every game of theirs. When playoff time comes most of my family watchs them with me. But I also sometimes watch them with friends which is really fun. I know a ton about the Warriors and they sparked my want to play basketball.</td>

<h2 style="color:darkblue;"><u>Soccer</u></h2>
<td>I like watching Soccer because I enjoy rooting for Chelsea Football Club, based in London, England. I like watching with my dad and my brother. The reason I like Chelsea is because I lived there (Chelsea is a neighborhood in London). I started to watch soccer when my dad introduced me to Engilsh Soccer on TV.</td>

<h2 style="color:darkblue;"><u>Football</u></h2>
<td>Although Football isn't one of the main sports I watch, like Soccer or Basketball, I like watching Stanford Collage Football in person. My family has had season tickets to Stanford Football for the past three seasons. I can hang out with friends at the games or watch with my dad and wildly root for Standford. I kinda like watching professional football every once and a while. But I really enjoy Stanford Football.</td>
